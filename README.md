# Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse Project** repository!

In this project a series of fictional datasets, mimicing a motoring and cycling store, were used to create a data warehouse similar that could be used to generate actional insights. The process and decision making was documented on notion and highlights industry best practices in data engineering.

As an MSc Data Science & Analytics student, completing this project has given me a better understanding of the entire data process.

The entire data warehousing process was completed in SQL to deepen my understanding and develop my experience of the language.

All of the files that need to be ran in order for Warehouse to be completed has been numbered '1' to '8'. Only the files with whole numbers need to be ran. e.g., '5.2' Should not be used and is only there to easily see a section of '5'.

!!!ATTENTION:  file: '3' Loading Data & Creating Procedure. In the bronze layer retrieves the data from the dataset and loads it into the table. The File path would need to be changed to match the location of where the dataset is stored on the device running the script!!!
