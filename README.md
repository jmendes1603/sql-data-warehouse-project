# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!

In this project a series of fictional datasets, mimicing a motoring and cycling store, were used to create a data warehouse similar that could be used to generate actional insights. The process and decision making was documented on notion and highlights industry best practices in data engineering.

As an MSc Data Science & Analytics student, completing this project has given me a better understanding of the entire data process.
